    question:
      "What is the time complexity of searching an element in a sorted array using Binary Search?",
    answer: "O(log n)",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a stack data structure?",
    answer:
      "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the 'top' of the stack.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a linked list?",
    answer:
      "A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the time complexity of inserting an element at the beginning of a dynamic array?",
    answer:
      "O(n), because all elements have to be shifted to make space for the new element.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a hash table?",
    answer:
      "A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index where the value should be stored or retrieved.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the time complexity of quicksort in the worst-case scenario?",
    answer: "O(n^2)",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a binary tree?",
    answer:
      "A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the 'left' and 'right' child.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is dynamic programming?",
    answer:
      "Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the time complexity of finding the smallest element in an unsorted array?",
    answer: "O(n), as you have to traverse the entire array once.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search)?",
    answer:
      "BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. DFS goes as far into the depth of the tree as possible before backtracking.",
  },
